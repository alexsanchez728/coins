# NSS Group Exercise: Coin Converter

## Project Description
> Write a program that will convert a dollar amount to the number of coins that make up the amount. Use the common American coins of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

## Final Product
We used Javascript to count up how many quarters are in a given amount, then how many dimes, nickles, and pennies until the amount could not be broken down further.
Then display how many of each coin make up that amount with a `console.log()`.

## How to Run it
Must have Node installed first
```
$ git clone https://github.com/alexsanchez728/coins.git
$ cd coins/
$ npm install http-server -g
$ http-server -p 8080
```

This will show up in your browser at:
`http://localhost:8080`
